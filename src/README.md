# Dotsy

Dotsy is a JavaScript library with which you can create HTML for randomly positioned, non-overlapping, customized dots. You can set:
- the height and width of the container
- the radius and color of each dot
Then Dotsy calculates the locations and creates the HTML for you.

This library can be used, for example, in software that may focus on:
- subitizing
- counting
- arithmetic

For a working example to play with online, see [symbolinker.github.io/dotsy](https://symbolinker.github.io/dotsy). Its source code can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/SymboLinker/dotsy/tree/main/docs) folder of the repository.

More documentation will follow.
