# Dotsy

Dotsy is a JavaScript library with which you can display randomly positioned non-overlapping dots in a rectangular HTML element. You can set:
- the radius and color of each dot
- the size of the rectangular container
... and then Dotsy creates the HTML for you.

This library can be used, for example, in software that may focus on:
- subitizing
- counting
- arithmetic

For a working example to play with online, see [symbolinker.github.io/dotsy](https://symbolinker.github.io/dotsy). Its source code can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/SymboLinker/dotsy/tree/main/docs) folder of the repository.

More documentation will follow.
